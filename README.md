## Components

#### 1. YouTuber

The YouTuber service allows users to publish videos on the YouTube server. It sends messages containing the video name and the YouTuberâ€™s name to the server.

#### 2. User

The User service allows users to subscribe or unsubscribe to YouTubers and receive real-time notifications whenever a YouTuber they subscribe to uploads a new video. Users communicate with the YouTube server to manage subscriptions and receive notifications.

#### 3. YouTube Server

The YouTube server consumes messages from both users and YouTubers, storing data, managing subscriptions, and sending notifications. It processes login, subscription, and unsubscription requests from users and handles video uploads from YouTubers.
